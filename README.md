Unlocked Emby based on https://github.com/nvllsvm/emby-unlocked and https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby. Probably won't end up being updated at all as it was created for my personal use; if you have the knowhow you're better off building nvllsvm's Emby unlocked for Windows than using this.

Honestly there's no reason for this to even exist. I didn't really know how GitHub worked until today.
